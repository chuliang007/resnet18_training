# resnet18_training

1. 'resnet18.cc' defines a ResNet18 training accelerator for CIFAR10.
2. layer functions used in the accelerator are defined in 'layer.h'.
3. Python codes for PyTorch simulations are included in 'BP_function' in directory of 'PyTorch_BP'.

P.S. Note that HLS C simulations cannot be processed due to no data streaming in.
